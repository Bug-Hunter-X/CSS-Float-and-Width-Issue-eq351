The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code snippet intends to make two divs take up 50% of the width of their parent container each. However, if the parent container's width is not specified explicitly, the divs might not always render as expected.
